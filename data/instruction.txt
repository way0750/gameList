1. First, download the resources at the following link: http://plexchat.com/resources/SimpleNavigationAssets.zip
2. Next, familiarize yourself with React Native (https://facebook.github.io/react-native/) to accomplish the following tasks.


3. Populate a list view (React.ListView) given the entries of the games.json file.
4. The list view cells should display the 'thumbnail' image as well as the game 'name' as they are defined in games.json (see wireframe).



5. When a game is selected a new game view should be pushed onto the navigation view.


6. The game view will display the 'image', 'caption', and 'comments' as they are defined in games.json (see wireframe).
7. A text input box at the bottom of the screen will allow the user to add a comment (don't worry about saving or persisting the new comment, it can disappear when you return to the game list).


commenting:
there's already an array of comments, show the latest first
user should be able to add more comments
